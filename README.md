Dear Princess Celestia,

# Maneplace map (modified by Mercy)

## How to set up
1. Download the [tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser
2. Create a new script in tampermonkey and paste the contents of the script.js file from this repo
3. Refresh maneplace
4. ???
5. Profit

## How to use
1. You will figure it out

## How to add your own templates
1. Start by making a template image. All template images must be the size of the canvas (1000 x 1000 by default) so what you need to do is create a 1000 x 1000 transparent png and position your art on it exactly as you want it to appear on the canvas
2. You can get the current canvas image [here](https://place.manechat.net/canvas-image) for easier alignment
3. Upload your template somewhere (preferably discord or imgur) and get the direct image link
4. For example, on discord you would r-click the picture and do `copy link`, on imgur you would r-click and press `copy image address`. If using discord then make sure to remove the extra stuff after the `?` in the link. E.g. `?width=612&height=612`
5. Here's an example template to make sure you understand `https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/764482316788957215/1031583634118938714/Untitled.png`
6. On the minimap hover over the template name (`mlp` by default) and then press `Add your own template!`
7. You will be asked to enter a name - can be anything, just make sure it's different from all the ones that already exist (you added or by default `mlp`)
8. Then enter your image link
9. If you did everything correctly then click on the `Template: x` button to cycle it to yours
10. ???
11. Profit
12. ...
13. Tampermonkey may ask you to allow cross origin sharing depending on the link you entered, just select `allow temporarily` or `always allow`.

## Changes from the original repo
- Removed all default templates except for `mlp`
- Removed a bunch of buttons from the menu (python bot, donations, etc.) to remove clutter
- Added ability to add your own templates via a new button
- Also added a few extra cross origins (discord and imgur)
- Stuff
